Glorious
===

Da-da...
Ahhh...
Hold my breath for three more years
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays
It's glorious
It's glorious
We were tired from the sleep
Scrabbled and we slept
Through the window came the rain
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
Being tired from the sleep
Hold my breath for three more year
Yeah, three years
On my own on Saturdays
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious


Doe
===
Top this
Da-da...
Tripping
I walk to where he's sitting
It's all salty
It's all salty
He knows It's good, it's real, it's pretty
It's all salty Timmy
It's all salty Timmy
It's all salty Timmy
He said Doe Doe Doe
Dared leave
We've burned the field completely
Ahhh... Last light
I feel it's real, it's pretty
It's all salty Timmy
It's all salty Timmy
It's all salty Timmy
He said Doe Doe Doe

Oh!
===
Oh!
Last flight
Get lost in the moss
And oh, oh
Fall in the neon mine
Push me down
Push me down
Push me down
Still rolling in the stones
Run to the log that's rotten
And oh, oh
Your soft belly bossing lows
Push me down
Push me down
Push me down
Run to the log that's rotten
Your soft belly bossing lows
Push me down
Push me down
Push me down

Hellbound
===
It lives in folds of red and steamy air
It lives in misery
Hellbound
Hellbound
Hellbound
Hellbound
Hellbound
Hellbound
Oh, oh we're falling
Falling down
Down
It lives, despite the knives internal
It lives marry me
Hellbound
Oh, we're falling
Falling down
Down
It lives in misery
Hellbound

When I was a Painter
===
In side lakes of Quarterly I've been
Heard stories of air velveteen
Twenty hours later I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
When I was a painter I painted you well
Too bad I have to die
You brought the essentials, perversion appeal
And many lovers at one time
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
On and on, on, on
In side lakes of Quarterly I've been
Heard stories of air velveteen
Twenty hours later I fill the room
With bad sex and bad TV
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
On and on, on, on

Fortunately Gone
===
I wait for you in heaven
On this perfect string of love
And drink your soup of magpies in a
Pottery bowl that looks
As I am now, brown, round and warm
Chime on a rain wet
An ankle, toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone
I wait for you
Chime on a rain wet
An ankle, toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone
I wait for you

Iris
===
Four hours in the pot, one hour out
It grows and I sleep standing up
When Iris sleeps over
What a book she'll write
Oh last night
Oh come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister, oh
We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour
Four hours to daylight, four hours and then
Pour water on me til I live again
When Iris sleeps over
It'll be alright
All last night
But come on, nobody wants that
Sister, sister, oh
We tried hour by hour
Hour by hour
Hour by hour

Opened
===
Walking on his highways
We leave the land
And float inside the dark, black water
Robin flies again
She flew low over the highways
And I saw the wind
Blowing back her barbie doll hair
Robin flies again
And in a kitchen in Kentucky
She thinks she's Peter Pan
And in the bottom of a concrete basement
Robin flies again


Only in 3's
===
Oh
Back burns are green and off for me and her
He's an ape, he's an ape, he's an angel
Only in 3's, oh
Only in 3's, oh yeah
Only in 3's, oh
Oh
Hay for a bed with her on my head
And you are the king, the same king who will burn me
Only in 3's, oh
Only in 3's, oh yeah
Only in 3's, oh

Lime House
===
I walk by, I fall down
For warm black tar forms balls
And black tar baby
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
Fall, stay for good
Oh live and live and live in the dark baby
Tar baby
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house
I'm in a lime house

Metal Man
===
I don't know how old I was
But it was a '65 pickup
I was lying on the ground
With flat iron bars over my head

One silver drop is all you need
To put a hole in your head at 2000 degrees
That's right man, you be the Metal Man
At 2000 degrees

That's hot
That's hot

And over my head the hot wire was sparking
I got something down on my chest
And it began to bubble

I was repairing my three on a tree
When a drip dropped down on me
That's right man, I'm the Metal Man
At 2000 degrees

That's hot
